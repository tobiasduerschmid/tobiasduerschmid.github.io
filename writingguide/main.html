          Here is a concise guide to the standard structure of a scientific paper and the specific purpose of each section.
          <h3 class="page-header">Abstract</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a standalone, high-level summary of the entire paper.  To help readers quickly decide if the full paper is relevant to their research or interests.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> The core <strong>problem</strong> (what challenge are we addressing and why is it relevant?), the <strong>approach/methods</strong> used (how are we addressing the problem?), the most important <strong>findings</strong> (what did we discover or how did we evaluate our approach?), and the main <strong>conclusion</strong> (what are the implications on the real world).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Introduction</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To establish the context and explain <em>why</em> the research was conducted. To hook the reader and clearly define the scope and importance of the study.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> Background information on the topic, the specific problem or knowledge gap being addressed, the key idea behind the approach or hypothesis being tested, and a brief outline of the paper's contributions (ideally an itemized list).</li>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> It is fine to overlap with the abstract. A good introduction is written so that the first sentence of each paragraph mirrors the abstract.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Related Work (or Literature Review)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To situate the new research within the existing body of knowledge and to prove the authors understand the field and to explicitly show how their new work is different, better, or builds upon what has already been done.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> A summary of previous studies relevant to the topic, highlighting their strengths and limitations. A comparison of how our work is different from theirs or how our work is based on theirs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Approach (or Methods / Methodology)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To explain <em>how</em> the research was conducted. To provide enough precise detail so that another qualified researcher could replicate the study and verify the findings.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> Detailed descriptions of the experimental design, materials, equipment, algorithms, datasets, or theoretical frameworks used.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To objectively present the data and findings. To state <em>what</em> was found without bias or subjective interpretation.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> The raw facts, statistics, graphs, tables, and charts resulting from the approach.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Discussion</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To interpret the results and explain their significance (the "so what?").  To give meaning to the data and demonstrate the broader implications of the findings.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> An analysis of whether the results answered the research question, how they compare to the "Related Work," and an honest acknowledgment of the study's limitations.</li>

          <h3 class="page-header">Conclusions & Future Work</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a final, memorable takeaway. To wrap up the narrative and point to the next steps for the scientific community.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> A brief restatement of the primary finding, the overall impact of the work on the field, and suggestions for future research directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> The conclusions section is NOT supposed to be a summary. The abstract is the summary. A conclusions section should synthesize the findings rather than repeat them and contextualize them.</li>
          </ul>
