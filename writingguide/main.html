          Here is a concise guide to the standard structure of a scientific paper and the specific purpose of each section.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a standalone, high-level summary of the entire paper.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> The core problem, the methodology used, the most important findings, and the main conclusion.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To help readers quickly decide if the full paper is relevant to their research or interests.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Introduction</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To establish the context and explain <em>why</em> the research was conducted.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> Background information on the topic, the specific problem or knowledge gap being addressed, the research question or hypothesis, and a brief outline of the paper’s contributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To hook the reader and clearly define the scope and importance of the study.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Related Work (or Literature Review)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To situate the new research within the existing body of knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> A summary of previous studies relevant to the topic, highlighting their strengths and limitations.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To prove the authors understand the field and to explicitly show how their new work is different, better, or builds upon what has already been done.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Approach (or Methods / Methodology)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To explain <em>how</em> the research was conducted.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> Detailed descriptions of the experimental design, materials, equipment, algorithms, datasets, or theoretical frameworks used.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To provide enough precise detail so that another qualified researcher could replicate the study and verify the findings.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To objectively present the data and findings.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> The raw facts, statistics, graphs, tables, and charts resulting from the approach.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To state <em>what</em> was found without bias or subjective interpretation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Discussion</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To interpret the results and explain their significance (the "so what?").</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> An analysis of whether the results answered the research question, how they compare to the "Related Work," and an honest acknowledgment of the study's limitations.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To give meaning to the data and demonstrate the broader implications of the findings.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="page-header">Conclusions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide a final, memorable takeaway.</li>
            <li><strong>What it includes:</strong> A brief restatement of the primary finding, the overall impact of the work on the field, and suggestions for future research directions.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To wrap up the narrative and point to the next steps for the scientific community.</li>
          </ul>
