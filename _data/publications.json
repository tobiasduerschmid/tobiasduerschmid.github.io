      "caption"   : "With the continuous advances of mobile graphics hardware, high-quality image stylization, e.g., based on image filtering, stroke-based rendering, and neural style transfer, is becoming feasible and increasingly used in casual creativity apps. Nowadays, users want to create and distribute their own works and become a prosumer, i.e., being both consumer and producer. However, the creativity facilitated by contemporary mobile apps, is typically limited with respect to the usage and application of pre-defined visual styles, that ultimately does not include their design and composition – an inherent requirement of prosumers. This thesis presents the concept and implementation of a GPU-based mobile application that enables to interactively design parameterizable image stylization effects on-device, by reusing building blocks of image processing effects and pipelines. The parameterization is supported by three levels of control: (1) convenience presets, (2) global parameters, and (3) local parameter adjustments using on-screen painting. Furthermore, the created visual styles are defined using a platform-independent document format and can be shared with other users via a web-based community platform. The presented app is evaluated with regard to variety and visual quality of the styles, run-time performance measures, memory consumption, and implementation complexity metrics to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. The results show that the app supports the interactive combination of complex effects such as neural style transfer, watercolor filtering, oil paint filtering, and pencil hatching filtering to create unique high-quality effects. This approach supports collaborative works for designing visual styles, including their rapid prototyping, A/B testing, publishing, and distribution. Hence, it satisfies the needs for creative expression of both professionals and novice users, i.e., the general public.",

We explore this vision with two surveys, two simple hardware prototypes, matching custom apps that provide users with access to a solution database, custom fabrication processes we designed specifically for these devices, and a user study conducted in situ on metro trains. Our findings suggest that mobile fabrication is a compelling next direction for personal fabrication. From our experience with the prototypes we derive hardware requirements to make mobile fabrication also technically feasible.",

But their implementations are generally not reusable as they are often well tailored to a specific context. We introduce a concept, that facilitates the reuse of their implementations by defining an abstract design pattern definition that can be instantiated with specialized design decisions. This approach is a meta-level Builder constructing design patterns as first-class citizens. It simplifies the application of design patterns by providing a pattern library and still being able to adjust it to the concrete context.",

At this, a multi-scale approach that processes image pyramids is introduced that uses flow-based joint bilateral upsampling to achieve deliberate levels of abstraction at multiple scales and interactive frame rates. The approach facilitates the implementation of interactive tools that adjust the appearance of filtering effects at run-time, which is demonstrated by an on-screen painting interface for per-pixel parameterization that fosters the casual creativity of non-artists.",

      "caption"   : "With the continuous development of mobile graphics hardware, interactive high-quality image stylization based on nonlinear filtering is becoming feasible and increasingly used in casual creativity apps. However, these apps often only serve high-level controls to parameterize image filters and generally lack support for low-level (artistic) control, thus automating art creation rather than assisting it. This work presents a GPU-based framework that enables to parameterize image filters at three levels of control: (1) presets followed by (2) global parameter adjustments can be interactively refined by (3) complementary on-screen painting that operates within the filters' parameter spaces for local adjustments. The framework provides a modular XML-based effect scheme to effectively build complex image processing chains-using these interactive filters as building blocks-that can be efficiently processed on mobile devices. Thereby, global and local parameterizations are directed with higher-level algorithmic support to ease the interactive editing process, which is demonstrated by state-of-the-art stylization effects, such as oil paint filtering and watercolor rendering.",

We demonstrate the benefits in an early case study using an image processing product line which enables more than 90% of code reuse.",
