    <p>Traditionally, code reviews are done only once before the code is merged into the main branch. ThÂŒis process does not continuously give feedback on code quality (especially of legacy code), does not support questions of new developers concerning existing code, and forces the developers to leave their IDE for commenting on code.</p>
